# Your requirement

Set up a repo for a react-native app that works on iphone and android.  Bring in the AR kits for both android and iphone and make sure the front-facing camera is the first screen displayed. Bring in the AR anchors for both as well and make it so you can set a placeholder anchor

For this I was used [`react-viro-cli`] in this time

**Note**: ARKit is only supported by devices with A9 or later processors (iPhone 6s/7/SE/8/X, iPad 2017/Pro) on **iOS 11**. You also need **Xcode 9** to build the project.


## How to run the project

1. `git clone https://github.com/ZhengGuoDeveloper/ReactNativeARKit.git`;
2. In the project folder, `yarn install` the dependencies (npm broken atm.)
3. npm start in root folder on terminal
4. download and install viro media from app store and google play store
5. turn on the viro media app and click the top left menu button and click Enter Testbed button
6. Please enter the link of terminal (for example: http://ed99af06.ngrok.io) in inputText and click the GO button
